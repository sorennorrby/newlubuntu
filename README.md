# newlubuntu
The idea here is that if you happened to crash your laptop into the concrete sidewalk. 
Just buy a second hand computer on Ebay.
Download the latest version of my favorite Linux flavour Lubuntu from http://lubuntu.net
Burn the distro on a CD and use it to install Lubuntu on your new computer. 

Download this file. 
Enter the following two commands in a command terminal:

sudo chmod +x newlubuntu.sh

./newlubuntu.sh

Then the tools named in this script should start to install on you new work horse.

Get back to beeing productive!
